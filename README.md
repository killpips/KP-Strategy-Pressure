# Complete Guide to Killpips KVO Strategy Pressure V1 Indicator (Beta)

## 1. Introduction

The **Killpips KVO (Killpips Volume Overlaps)** indicator, released in **Beta version**, has been developed to apply the **Killpips strategy** in a structured manner through advanced volume analysis in relation to specific proprietary levels called **KVO**.

The indicator's objective is to provide a **clear reading of market directionality** and high-probability operational areas, using a **proprietary algorithm** that combines price dynamics, volume pressure, and reference levels.

---

## 2. Foundations of the Killpips Strategy

The Killpips strategy is based on three essential structural elements:

* **KVO Levels (Killpips Volume Overlaps)**
* **Volume pressure and dynamics**
* **Signal contextualization in the market**

Signals generated by the indicator **must never be interpreted in isolation**, but always analyzed in relation to KVO levels and the current market structure.

---

## 3. KVO Levels (Killpips Volume Overlaps)

**KVO Daily levels** represent areas of significant volume concentration and overlap.

Main characteristics:

* They are **automatically calculated and plotted** by the indicator
* They derive from **proprietary volumetric algorithms**
* Level inputs are **fixed and non-modifiable**
* They act as **dynamic market support and resistance**

The algorithm uses KVO levels as the primary reference for interpreting volume pressure and generating operational signals.

---

## 4. Signal Types

The indicator generates two main categories of operational signals:

### 4.1 Momentum Signals

**Momentum** signals indicate the probability of **continuation of the current movement**.

Operational characteristics:

* They are generated when volume pressure **supports price movement**
* They are particularly effective near KVO levels or during breakout phases
* They highlight active participation and market strength

---

### 4.2 Contrarian Signals

**Contrarian** signals indicate a **potential exhaustion phase** of the current movement.

Operational characteristics:

* They emerge in the presence of **volume imbalances or absorption**
* They frequently manifest near KVO levels
* They anticipate possible reversals or corrective price phases

---

### 4.3 Overlapping Signals

Under certain market conditions, **both a Momentum signal and a Contrarian signal may appear on the same candle**.

This scenario indicates:

* Coexistence of directional pressure
* Simultaneous presence of possible exhaustion signals

In such situations, it is essential to strengthen contextual analysis, evaluating position, structure, and price reaction relative to KVO levels.

---

## 5. Signal Confirmation and Operational Timing

* All signals are **confirmed exclusively at candle close**
* The **opening of the next candle** represents the technical reference for operational entry

This approach reduces the incidence of unconfirmed intrabar signals and promotes greater operational discipline.

---

## 6. Volume Fill and Pressure Line

### 6.1 Colored Fill

The **colored fill** graphically displays **volume pressure**:

* Coloration varies according to volume intensity
* Allows assessment of movement continuity and quality
* Can be used as support for position management

---

### 6.2 Broken Line

The **broken line** signals a phase of **reduced volume pressure**.

It appears when:

* Volumes begin to lose intensity
* The market shows signs of slowdown or possible reversal

It represents an element of attention in trade management and profit protection.

---

## 7. Input Structure

The indicator's inputs are organized into three main sections:

### 7.1 ALGO

Contains the algorithm's operating parameters:

* **Factor**: has three levels (1, 2, 5). Value 1 is oriented toward aggressive scalping trading, value 2 toward sustained directional trading, while value 5 provides a smoother reading suitable for swing trading contexts.
* **Primary Momentum**: parameter that regulates the intensity of the primary momentum calculation.
* **Secondary Momentum**: parameter that influences the degree of secondary momentum calculation.
* **Contrarian**: parameter that defines the sensitivity of the contrarian module.

---

### 7.2 Trading Session

Allows you to:

* Select market sessions of interest
* Establish **in which time windows the indicator should generate signals**

This function allows adaptation of operations to your style and reference market.

---

### 7.3 KVO Daily Levels

Section dedicated exclusively to KVO levels:

* **Preset and non-modifiable** values
* No manual adjustment required

---

## 8. Recommended Markets and Timeframes (Beta Version)

In the Beta phase, the indicator is optimized for the following markets:

* NQ
* ES
* YM
* RTY
* GC
* CL

**Recommended timeframe:**

* 5 minutes

**Suggested settings:**

* Factor: 2
* Primary Momentum: 1.5
* Secondary Momentum: 1.5
* Contrarian: 1.5

---

## 9. Operational Signal Management

### 9.1 Stop Loss

Stop Loss can be positioned:

* Above or below the candle that generated the signal
* Alternatively, beyond the **nearest KVO level (recommended)**

---

### 9.2 Target and Position Management

Targets can be identified:

* On the next KVO level consistent with the trade direction

In the presence of extended movements:

* It is possible to accompany the position using the colored fill as reference
* Apply dynamic management through **manual trailing**

---

## 10. Contextualization and Operational Discipline

The indicator **does not constitute an automated trading system**.

Every signal must be:

* Contextualized in the market
* Evaluated in relation to KVO levels
* Inserted within proper risk management

Operational discipline remains the central element of applying the Killpips strategy.
